# Sketch Template for Ninja Forms Opinionated Styles
A sketch template of form fields styled with the Ninja Forms Opinionated Styles theme.

## Prerequisites

* [Libre Franklin](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Franklin) - The sans-serif font used by Twenty Seventeen
* [Font Awesome v4.7.0](http://fontawesome.io/) - The icon webfont used by Ninja Forms
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) - The digital design toolkit

## Notes

* This template is based off of a form rendered by Firefox Developer Edition 59.0b2 on a stock Wordpress 4.9.2 installation using the Twenty Seventeen theme.
* To make recoloring and font changes easier, I've created text and object styles for many of the form elements.
* The template currently only covers the light version of the opinionated styles theme. The dark theme and components from some of the add-ons will be added at a later date.
